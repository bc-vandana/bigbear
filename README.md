# BigBear
## A game that motivates people to make volunteering a happy habit.

### Inspiration
Today, nonprofits are always short on manpower, which compromises their ability to provide services like housing, food, and shelter to underserved communities. Imagine the social good that could be achieved if nonprofits had a constant stream of volunteers. Recent statistics place the value of one nonprofit volunteer in the U.S. at around $25/hour - in California, it’s even higher at $29/hour.

However, the rate of volunteering in the U.S. has been declining. During 2015, volunteering was recorded at just 24.9% nationally, representing the lowest level since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began comparing data on volunteers. In 2011, this percentage was 26.8%, and in 2005 it was 28.8%. This decline in volunteering behavior is most pronounced in Gen Z (born after 1997), the most ethnically-diverse and largest generation in American history.

"We are the first generation to have had access to smartphones our whole lives. We communicate through social media and texts, which changes the dynamic of communication." — 19-year-old

"Everything in our generation is immediate. Since we have been raised in an age where texts and messages can be sent in the blink of an eye, we are less patient than other generations because we are used to having instant gratification.”
— 15-year-old

Let's reverse this trend and motivate people (especially tech-addicted teens from Gen Z) to volunteer in perpetuity: if the completion of each volunteering task felt as delightful as catching a Pokemon in Pokemon Go, people would volunteer more, and they'd feel energetic and motivated as they were doing it.

### What it does
Nonprofits enter tasks into Big Bear, and those tasks get surfaced to potential volunteers. Upon completion of each task, the nonprofit rewards the volunteers with delightful virtual badges that get displayed in Big Bear. The more badges a volunteer has on their Big Bear profile, the higher their Big Bear level becomes, and the more rare badges they unlock.

If a volunteer’s performance on a task is exemplary, the nonprofit can distribute additional badges accordingly. These badges also display on each volunteer’s profile and elevate their “Big Bear street cred.”
